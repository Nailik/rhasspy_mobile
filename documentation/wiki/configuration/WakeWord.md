This service is is used to listen to a WakeWord while in `Idle` State.
<br/>Best used with [[Background]] Services enabled to ensure WakeWord is running in background.
<br/>The following options are available:

| Option             | Information                                                |

| MQTT               | awaits [[Mqtt Api]] `hermes/hotword/<wakewordId>/detected` | 
| UDP Audio (Output) | Sends audio chunks to via UDP                              | 
| Disabled           | Nothing                                                    | 

<br/>
<br/>
## Porcupine (local)

Porcupine recognized the Wake Word locally on your device without sending data to the internet.<br/>
Internet access is once required to verify the AccessKey.

### Setup

1. Create a free AccessKey on the [PicoVoice Console](https://console.picovoice.ai/)
2. Setup the AccessKey in the App
3. Choose Your language
4. Choose your wake word

* You can choose multiple Wake Words but they are all in the same (selected) language
* Custom Wake Words can be created in the [PicoVoice Console](https://console.picovoice.ai/ppn)

5. When initially saving the Configuration it's necessary to have internet access because the
   AccessKey is checked by Porcupine

<br/>
<br/>
## MQTT

The MQTT option doesn't record audio, it awaits that some external device sends a message on the
topic
`hermes/hotword/<wakewordId>/detected` as defined in [[Mqtt Api]].< /br>
There is more information in the
official [Rhasspy Docs](https://rhasspy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/wake-word/#:~:text=no-,MQTT/Hermes,-Rhasspy%20listens%20for).

<br/>
<br/>
## UDP-Audio (Output)

In this configuration the audio is send in small packets to a Udp Port on a specific IP.

1. Insert the Rhasspy IP or DNS name (without http:// because it's UDP) and the Port
2. Setup your Rhasspy base to read the incoming data, this depends on what your base is running on:

### Home assistant add on

* In AddOns -> Rhasspy -> Configuration -> "Port for HTTP POST audio stream input" you need to
  select a `<Port>`
* On the Rhasspy Website insert `0.0.0.0:<Port>` inside Wake Word -> `UDP Audio (input)`

### Rhasspy inside Docker

* The UDP port needs to be added to the run command, for example (more information in the
  official [Rhasspy Docs](https://rhasspy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation/#docker) ):

```
$ docker run -d -p 12101:12101 -p 20000:20000/udp \
      --name rhasspy \
      --restart unless-stopped \
      -v "$HOME/.config/rhasspy/profiles:/profiles" \
      -v "/etc/localtime:/etc/localtime:ro" \
      --device /dev/snd:/dev/snd \
      rhasspy/rhasspy \
      --user-profiles /profiles \
      --profile en
```

here in addition to Port `12101` also Port `20000` is opened.

* On the Rhasspy Website insert `127.0.0.1:<Port>` inside Wake Word -> `UDP Audio (input)`
  The correct IP can be checked with `docker ps`

### Multiple inputs

* It's possible to use multiple UDP Ports in your rhasspy base
* For example insert `<IP>:<Port>:<Device1>,<IP>:<Port>:<Device2>` into Wake
  Word -> `UDP Audio (input)`
* Make sure that you add the `<Device1>,<Device2>` to `Satellite siteIds:` when they don't match
  your base name
